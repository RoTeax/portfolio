			<h2>About the page</h2>
			<br>	
			<p>The goal of this page was to create a portfolio website showing off what I can do in JavaScript.</p>
			<p>This website is to include all different kinds of programs that I created/customised during Term 1 of the 2nd year at DID.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The first program created was the Adventure Game. It was a basic text program giving you options to choose from.</p>
			<p>Depending on which option you chose, different actions and new options appear. This was achieved with if, else if, else and switch statements.</p>		
			<p>I also included .innerText lines to replace the console.log functions that were used earlier during the course.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately this caused some errors that I was not able to solve just yet.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Second program is a ceasar cypher. This was a bit more advanced. The goal of this program is to encode a sentence.</p>
			<p>For this I needed to use arrays, for statements, eventListeners and getElementById attributes.</p>
			<p>The program now runs successfully and almost fully decodes your cypher as well. The only problems I was not able to fix yet are decoding the letters a, b and c.</p>
			<br>
			<p>On to program number 3. The hotel booking system. This program's goal was to have people be able to book into and check out of a room.</p>
			<p>This program required arrays, objects, if, else if statements and functions. We first created an object containing the hotel information</p>
			<p>This information was the amount of rooms available, maximum amount of rooms and taken rooms.</p>
			<p>In my knowledge this program runs smoothly.</p>
			<br>
			<p>For the fourth program I knew there would be some new and more complicated attributes/statements to use.</p>
			<p>The fourth program was all about creating a credit card reader of some sorts. It's supposed to be able to take your card data and determine if it is a valid card and tell which type of card it is.</p>
			<p>So we needed to read in the card date through inputs. Once the data is in I compaired it to parts of the data that determines wether a card is valid or not.</p>
			<p>The new attributes used in this program that weren't used before are the .slice and number attributes.</p>
			<p>This program runs well. If the expiry date is a passed date it will call the card invalid, if the card is valid, it will return card type.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Fifth and currently last is the array practice program I had to customise. </p>
